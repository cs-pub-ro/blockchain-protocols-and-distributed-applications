# Fungible vs Non-Fungible Tokens

* Fungibility refers to an asset's ability to be exchanged for something else of equal value;
* Some examples of fungible assets include currencies, commodities, and precious stones;
* Non-fungible assets are unique, requiring much more complex valuation before a sale and include things like real estate, art, and sports cards.
