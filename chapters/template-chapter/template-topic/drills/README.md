# Practice: Baby Steps

We recommend that for practice, you add a subsection for the exercises.
This will make it so you can delimit the exercises from the lab's text.

1. You can number the exercises as such.
   And have the text roll over to the next line.

1. This is a second numbered exercise.

   **Be careful!**
   You can even link to other chapters internally [like this](questions.md)

   Another neat feature is that you can add inline code that uses language specific highlight.

   ```Python
   with event:
       while len(messages) == 0:
           event.wait()
   ```

   For now, a quiz can only be linked to as such: [Quiz 1](questions.md)
