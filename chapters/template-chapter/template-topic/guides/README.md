## Executable Paths

Single instances of commands should be written using monotype fonts such as this `ls`.

For longer outputs, you will use the following syntax:

```console
student@os:~$ which ls
/usr/bin/ls

student@os:~$ file /usr/bin/ls
/usr/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=6e3da6f0bc36b6398b8651bbc2e08831a21a90da, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```
