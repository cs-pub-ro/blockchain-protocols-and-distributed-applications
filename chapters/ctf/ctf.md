# Capture the flag

Let's see who can get the highest score!

This repo contains 3 challenges:
1. [Bump](bump.md)
2. [Coinflip](coinflip.md)
3. [GasPass](gaspass.md)

All these challenges can be completed using nothing but Rust interactors and smart contracts, but of couse, you are free to use any technology you prefer.

## Setup

Make sure to have your own account, then communicate to the team which one is your wallet.

The challenge contracts are already deployed to devnet:

```
gateway = 'https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com'
bump_address = "erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqnqw2aep56p5hg5ksualpfwav55pvaafjd8ssg4pur0"
coinflip_address = "erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqmzaphnyv5gs0jkvr6sywtynj0s3a53rnd8ss29w0hr"
gaspass_address = "erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgquvpnteagc5xsslc3yc9hf6um6n6jjgzdd8ss07v9ma"
```

Best of luck!
