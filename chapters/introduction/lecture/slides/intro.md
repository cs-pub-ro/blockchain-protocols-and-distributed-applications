### What is Web3?

**The Evolution of the Internet:**

1. **First Era (1990-2005):** Open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. Most value accrued to users and builders.

2. **Second Era (2005-2020):** Siloed, centralized services. Most value accrued to a handful of large tech companies.

3. **Third Era (2020+):** Web3 - combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of the first era with the advanced, modern functionality of the second era.
