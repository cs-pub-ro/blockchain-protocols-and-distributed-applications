## Feedback

You should always verify the recipient address before confirming a transaction. This is crucial because blockchain transactions are irreversible - once sent, you cannot get your funds back if you send them to the wrong address. Double-checking the address helps prevent costly mistakes and protects your funds from being sent to unintended recipients.
