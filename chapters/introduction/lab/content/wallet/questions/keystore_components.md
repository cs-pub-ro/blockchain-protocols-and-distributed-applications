## Feedback

A MultiversX keystore file contains cryptographic components like ciphertext (encrypted data), cipher (encryption algorithm), kdf (key derivation function), and mac (message authentication code), but it does not contain blockchain-specific information. The keystore is a generic cryptographic container that can be used across different networks.
