## Feedback

Your 24-word mnemonic phrase is the most reliable way to recover a MultiversX wallet. The mnemonic phrase is a human-readable representation of your private key that can be used to regenerate the entire wallet, including all addresses and private keys. This is why it's crucial to store your mnemonic phrase securely and never share it with anyone.
