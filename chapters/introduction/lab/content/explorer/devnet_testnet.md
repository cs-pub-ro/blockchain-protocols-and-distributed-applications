# Devnet & Testnet Blockchain

While developing applications, there is a need for a development/testing blockchain.

Inspect:
* [MultiversX Testnet Explorer](https://testnet-explorer.multiversx.com/)
* [MultiversX Devnnet Explorer](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com/)
* [Goerli Ethereum Testnet Explorer](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)
* [Sepolia Ethereum Testnet Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)

What differences can you observe?

These blockchains offer the `Faucet` option where you can mint blockchain tokens (eGLD, ETH, etc.).
This way the development is easier for the community.

**NOTE**

All the tokens are "fake" tokens. They are only used to mock the real tokens on the Mainnet.
