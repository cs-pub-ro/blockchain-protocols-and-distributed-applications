# Setting up your environment

In this section we will install all the requirements needed for the practical sessions.
This includes the following:
- rustup - The Rust toolchain installer
- MetaMask - Ethereum wallet
- mxpy - tool for interacting with the blockchain
- sc-meta - universal smart contract management tool


## Rustup - The Rust toolchain installer

Rust is installed and managed by the `rustup` tool.
If you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update your installation by running `rustup update`.

For more informantion, please check [rustup documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/).

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```



### Configuring the PATH environment variable

In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

During installation `rustup` will attempt to configure the `PATH`. Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in `rustup`, the modifications to `PATH` may not take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out, or it may not succeed at all.

Please make sure you have included  `~/.cargo/bin` directory in your `PATH` environment variable.

Please verify that `rustup` was succesffully install with `rustup --version`.

### Uninstall Rust

If at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run `rustup self uninstall`.

## MultiversX prerequisites

### mxpy

Mxpy is a tool for interaction with the blockchain:
```shell

staking-provider               Staking provider omnitool
dns                            Operations related to the Domain Name Service
```

Before installing `mxpy`, please make sure you have a working `Python 3` environment. You'll need `Python 3.8` or later on Linux or MacOS.

The recommended way to install `mxpy` is by using `pipx`.
If you'd like to use `mxpy` on Windows, we recommend installing it within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

In order to install `mxpy` using `pipx`, run the following command:
```shell
pipx install multiversx-sdk-cli --force
```

To check that mxpy installed successfully you can run the following command:
```shell
mxpy --version
```

### wasm32-unknown-unknown

This is WebAssembly target which uses 32-bit memories. It is used to compile MultiversX smart contracts to WebAssembly.

To add it, please use:
```shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### sc-meta

This tool is used to compile smart contracts.

To install it, run:
```shell
cargo install multiversx-sc-meta --locked
```

To verify that it's correctly installed, run:
```shell
sc-meta --version
```


## Ethereum prerequisites

### MetaMask

MetaMask is a web browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Ethereum private keys. 
By doing so, it serves as a wallet for Ether and other tokens, and allows you to interact with decentralized applications, or *dapps*.

Please visit [this](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/#how-to-install-metamask) to install MetaMask as a browser extension (Safari is not supported) or as a mobile app.


### Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It consists of different components for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.

To install Hardhat, use:
```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To verify that hardhat is install, run:
```shell
$ npx hardhat
