# Setting up your environment

In this section we will install all the requirements needed for the practical sessions.
This includes the following:
- rustup - The Rust toolchain installer
- MetaMask - Ethereum wallet
- mxpy - tool for interacting with the blockchain
- sc-meta - universal smart contract management tool
- Solana CLI - tool for interacting with Solana blockchain
- Anchor - Solana smart contract framework
- Phantom - Solana wallet
- Solflare - Alternative Solana wallet with advanced features


## Rustup - The Rust toolchain installer

Rust is installed and managed by the `rustup` tool.
If you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update your installation by running `rustup update`.

For more informantion, please check [rustup documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/).

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```



### Configuring the PATH environment variable

In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

During installation `rustup` will attempt to configure the `PATH`. Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in `rustup`, the modifications to `PATH` may not take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out, or it may not succeed at all.

Please make sure you have included  `~/.cargo/bin` directory in your `PATH` environment variable.

Please verify that `rustup` was succesffully install with `rustup --version`.

### Uninstall Rust

If at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run `rustup self uninstall`.

## MultiversX prerequisites

### mxpy

Mxpy is a tool for interaction with the blockchain:
```shell

Before installing `mxpy`, please make sure you have a working `Python 3` environment. You'll need `Python 3.8` or later on Linux or MacOS.

The recommended way to install `mxpy` is by using `pipx`.
If you'd like to use `mxpy` on Windows, we recommend installing it within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

In order to install `mxpy` using `pipx`, run the following command:
```shell
pipx install multiversx-sdk-cli --force
```

To check that mxpy installed successfully you can run the following command:
```shell
mxpy --version
```

### wasm32-unknown-unknown

This is WebAssembly target which uses 32-bit memories. It is used to compile MultiversX smart contracts to WebAssembly.

To add it, please use:
```shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### sc-meta

This tool is used to compile smart contracts.

To install it, run:
```shell
cargo install multiversx-sc-meta --locked
```

To verify that it's correctly installed, run:
```shell
sc-meta --version
```


## Ethereum prerequisites

### MetaMask

MetaMask is a web browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Ethereum private keys. 
By doing so, it serves as a wallet for Ether and other tokens, and allows you to interact with decentralized applications, or *dapps*.

Please visit [this](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/#how-to-install-metamask) to install MetaMask as a browser extension (Safari is not supported) or as a mobile app.


### Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It consists of different components for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.

To install Hardhat, use:
```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To verify that hardhat is install, run:
```shell
$ npx hardhat

## Solana prerequisites

### Solana CLI Tools

The Solana Command Line Interface (CLI) tools allow you to interact with Solana clusters, manage accounts, and deploy programs.

Install the Solana CLI tools using the official installer:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```

**Note**: If you encounter an SSL connection error (like `curl: (35) LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL`), try these alternative methods:

**Method 1 - Use Homebrew (Recommended for macOS):**
```shell
brew install solana
```

**Method 2 - Download script manually:**
```shell
curl -O https://release.solana.com/stable/install
sh install
```

**Method 3 - Try with different curl options:**
```shell
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto '=https' -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install | sh
```


After installation, you need to add the Solana programs to your system's PATH. Add the following line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc`):

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell profile:

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

To verify that the Solana CLI was installed successfully, run:

```shell
solana --version
```

### Solana Test Validator

For local development and testing, you can run a local Solana cluster using the test validator:

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

This command starts a local Solana cluster that you can use for development. It's recommended to run this command in a separate terminal window that remains open during development.

To configure the CLI to use the local validator:

```shell
solana config set --url localhost
```

### Anchor Framework

Anchor is a framework for Solana that simplifies smart contract development by providing a convenient way to build Solana programs.

Install Anchor using the Anchor Version Manager (AVM):

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

To verify that Anchor is correctly installed, run:

```shell
anchor --version
```

### Solana Web3.js

For client-side development, you'll need the Solana Web3.js library. Install it using npm:

```shell
npm install @solana/web3.js
```
